The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It uses the [cocoa](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme/) theme. The posts are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

The primary font face is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and the monospace font face is [Ubuntu Mono](http://font.ubuntu.com/). The social icons are from the [Ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons) font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).
